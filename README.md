# Food-Recognition
🍔👁 Food Vision Big
In the previous notebook (transfer learning part 3: scaling up) we built Food Vision mini: a transfer learning model which beat the original results of the Food101 paper with only 10% of the data.

But you might be wondering, what would happen if we used all the data?

Well, that's what we're going to find out in this project

We're going to be building Food Vision, using all of the data from the Food101 dataset.

Yep. All 75,750 training images and 25,250 testing images.
